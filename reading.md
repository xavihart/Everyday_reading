# Conference Tutorials / Lectures

- MIT Deep Learning Seminar highlighting recent work (January 2020) by Animesh Garg
  - Generalization of Robot for different bu similar tasks
    - current paradigm: e.g. Deep RL, env + action + states + reward, sampling inefficient and unstable
    - current paradigm: Visuo-motor skills, need to carefully design the robot model for specifc scene
    - current paradigm, DRL + Visuo-motor
- CVPR workshop on solution to general robot by Pieter Abbeel
- RSS 2020 KeyNotes of Cognitive Core for Robot Learning by Josh Tenenbaum
