# Conference Tutorials / Lectures

#### MIT Deep Learning Seminar highlighting recent work (January 2020) by Animesh Garg
  - Generalization of Robot for different bu similar tasks
    - current paradigm: e.g. Deep RL, env + action + states + reward, sampling inefficient and unstable
    - current paradigm: Visuo-motor skills, need to carefully design the robot model for specifc scene
    - current paradigm, DRL + Visuo-motor, policy -> velocity, impedence of end effector
  - Heuristics often beats RL
    - How can human guide help with robot training (Human in-loop training): Imitation from human heuristics, off-policy RL DDPG
  -  Sequential Tasks
     - Grasp + Oriented-tasks
     - Multi-step reasoning
       - **CAVIN, hierachical planning** (http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/cavin/)

  - Compositional Planning (Generalized)
       - states (e.g. videos) -> program (pick blue, lift bule, place blue, pick red, lift red ...), instead of just ouput actions using end-to-end way
       - task graphs
  - Data for Robotics
    - largest data source : direcly from videos
    - current robot data is much fewer than that of CV and NLP
      - **experts needs show, not label**

#### Generative Neural Scene Representationsfor 3D-Aware Image Synthesis

  - By Andreas Geiger from MPI
    - We need control over the image generation process ! 
    - Goal:
      - generate photorealistic images
      - control individual objects, appearance, pose, size in 3D
      - novel view image synthesis
      - train from raw images without pose information
    - representation used ?
      - voxel (PlanoticGAN, iccv2019)
        - sample -> voxel 3D -> render
        - low fidelity
      - deep-voxel (HOLOGAN, iccv2019)
        - sample -> deep voxel(feature) -> NN + render
      - generative radiance field
        - sample -> radiance field -> render
    - GRAF: 
    - Train

#### Towards Causal Representation Learning

- By Bengio, 2020

- Gap between current ML and HUMAN-LEVEL AI

  - causality, inference, explain things happening

- Compositionality helps IID AND OOD Generalization

  - Systematic Generalization
  - E.G. driving in a new city, science fiction (combination of seen objects)

- Conscious Processing Helps Humans Deal With OOD

  - FACED WITH NEW SITUATIONS, HUMANS CAN CALL UP ON-THE-FLY KNOWLEDGES AND USE THEM TO INFERENCE AND MAKE SOLUTIONS
  - AGENTS FACE NON-STATIONARITIES

- TWO Systems : Sys1 vs Sys2 (By Daniel Kahneman)

  - Sup:

    - ```
      Israeli-American psychologist and Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman is the founding father of modern behavioral economics. His work has influenced how we see thinking, decisions, risk, and even happiness.
      
      In Thinking, Fast and Slow, his “intellectual memoir,” he shows us in his own words some of his enormous body of work.
      
      Part of that body includes a description of the “machinery of … thought,” which divides the brain into two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which “respectively produce fast and slow thinking.” For our purposes, these can also be thought of as intuitive and deliberate thought.
      
      
      ```

    - System1: intuitive, simple, one-step logic, fast, on-effort (current DL)

    - System2: conscious, complex, logic, slow, hard (future DL)

- SOME sys2 inductive priors:

  - Sparse factor graph in space of high-level semantic variables
  - Semantic variables are causal: agents, intentions, controllable objects
  -
