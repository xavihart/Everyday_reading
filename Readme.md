## Vision

### 3D Perception / NeRF

- Unsupervised Discovery of Object Radiance Fields

- Spatial Transformer Networks:white_check_mark:

- Point-Voxel CNN for Efficient 3D Deep Learning:white_check_mark:

- GRF

- NeX:white_check_mark:

- pixel-NeRF:white_check_mark:

- Plenoxels: Radiance Fields without Neural Networks :white_check_mark:

  - No Neural Nets, 100 times faster on training 
  - Data Structure: Sparse Voxel = (Spherical Harmonic Basis + Opacity)
  - Rendering: Neural Rendering, Trilinear Interpolation
  - Optimization: reconstruction loss + total variation loss (smooth variation)
  - Key: the paper demonstrate that : the soa performance on novel view synthesis of NeRF lies on the Neural Rendering Reconstruction, but not on NN.

- D-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes (CVPR2021)

- PlenOctTree :white_check_mark:

  - real-time nerf rendering, OCTree structure
  - using spherical harmonic basis to encode view-dependent effects, which is much faster than conventional NeRF rendering where NN inference is needed 
  - learn F: (x, y, z) -> (SHs, $\sigma$)

# Conference Tutorials / Lectures

- MIT Deep Learning Seminar highlighting recent work (January 2020) by Animesh Garg
  - Generalization of Robot for different bu similar tasks
    - current paradigm: e.g. Deep RL, env + action + states + reward, sampling inefficient and unstable
    - current paradigm: Visuo-motor skills, need to carefully design the robot model for specifc scene
    - current paradigm, DRL + Visuo-motor, policy -> velocity, impedence of end effector
  - Heuristics often beats RL
    - How can human guide help with robot training (Human in-loop training): Imitation from human heuristics, off-policy RL DDPG
  -  Sequential Tasks
     - Grasp + Oriented-tasks
     - Multi-step reasoning
       - **CAVIN, hierachical planning** (http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/cavin/)

  - Compositional Planning (Generalized)
       - states (e.g. videos) -> program (pick blue, lift bule, place blue, pick red, lift red ...), instead of just ouput actions using end-to-end way
       - task graphs
  - Data for Robotics
    - largest data source : direcly from videos
    - current robot data is much fewer than that of CV and NLP
      - **experts needs show, not label**
      - RoboTurk (? set games for human to collect human manipulations?)
